                    <p>All the animals in the jungle had a king. The birds were jealous. They wanted a king too.
                        ‘Let me be the king. Look at my wonderful colours!’ said the beautiful parakeet.
                        ‘No, no’ said the myna. ‘I can speak and talk to the other animals.
                        I should be king.’, ‘and I have a fantastic beak!’ said toucan. ‘I want to be the bird king.’.
                        ‘I know,’ said the macaw. ‘Why don’t we have a competition? The bird who can fly the highest will be the bird king.’.
                        Everyone thought this was an excellent idea, especially the eagle. ‘Make me king now’ he said. ‘I am the strongest,
                        and I can fly the highest.’. ‘Ah’ said the little voice. ‘But you might not win!’. ‘Haha!’ laughed the eagle.
                        ‘You can’t beat me, little sparrow!’, ‘We’ll see’, said the sparrow. The race began, and all the birds flew high into the sky. 
                        They flew higher and higher, and the eagle flew the highest. ‘Ha! I told you!’ squawked the eagle. ‘I, I am the king!’.
                        But the sparrow was hiding under the eagle’s wing. Suddenly, he flew higher than the eagle’s head.
                        The sparrow was the highest bird of all! He won the competition!
                        And the sparrow was the new bird king.</p>

                    <p>	For the <b>first</b> activity, I will ask students to read the story. I will give them 2 minutes. Then, I will ask them to tell me the themes of the story. I will make a conversation on the story with the students, and then reveal the themes (Having an unfair competition, being envious of the others, being prideful, going at the smart way).<br><br> 
                        Then, I will reach to the main idea of the story by conversing with the students and building on their opinions. The main idea being: Do not overestimate yourself, and never underestimate the others.
                        <br><br>
                    For the <b>second</b> activity, I will ask students to quickly read the story again. Then, I will present these questions about the story to the students. 
                    <br>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Why did the birds decided to choose a king?</li>
                                <i>(I will answer the first one: Because they were jealous of the other animals.)</i><br>
                            <li>Parakeet has blend colours. True or false?</li>
                            <li>Toucan can speak to the other animals. True or false?</li>
                            <li>Eagle is the strongest bird of them all. True or false?</li>
                            <li>Sparrow was weak. True or false?</li>
                            <li>Sparrow had a splendid beak. True or false?</li>
                        </ol>
                    <br>
                    I will take the students answers and respond to them accordingly.
